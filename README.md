# Plotlyrb

Use [plotly](https://plot.ly) to graph your data.

Currently only supports `plot_image`, which uses the REST API to generate an image for your plot. See [the python reference](https://plot.ly/python/reference/) for details on what you can plot.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'plotlyrb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install plotlyrb

## Usage

```ruby
data = {
  :x => ['2013-10-04 22:23:00', '2013-11-04 22:23:00', '2013-12-04 22:23:00'],
  :y => [1, 3, 6],
  :type => 'scatter'
}

layout = { :xaxis => { :title => 'times' },
           :yaxis => { :title => 'bigfoot sightings', :range => [0, 7] },
}

plotly = Plotlyrb::PlotImage.new('my-plotly-username', 'my-plotly-api-key')
plotly.plot_image(data, 'plot.png', :png, layout)
```

## TODO
- [ ] Support height and width
- [ ] Test more plot types
- [ ] Use data structures/abstractions for plot types, data, etc. ?
